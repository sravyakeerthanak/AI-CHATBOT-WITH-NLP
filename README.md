## Task 3: AI Chatbot with NLP (Python)

This project is part of the **CodeTech Python Programming Internship**. The objective of Task 3 is to build a simple chatbot using Python that can respond to user queries.

In this task, a rule-based chatbot is implemented. The chatbot takes user input from the terminal and responds based on keyword matching. It uses basic conditional logic to identify greetings, simple questions, and exit commands.

The chatbot runs in a loop and continues the conversation until the user types "bye" to exit. Although it is not a machine learning-based chatbot, it demonstrates the fundamental concept of conversational systems and text processing in Python.

This project focuses on understanding user input handling, string processing, conditional statements, and basic chatbot logic.
